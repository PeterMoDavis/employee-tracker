# Employee Tracker

# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

My motivation for this project was to provide a business with a way to manage it's employees, departments and job roles.</b>
The user can easily:

- Add departments, roles, employees</br>

- View departments, roles, employees</br>

- Update employee roles</br>

as well as</br>

- Delete departments, roles, employees</br>
- Update employee manager id's</br>

All of these things are possible by simply answering a few prompts on their command line. During the process of making this project I learned how to store, select and retrieve into and from an mySql data base.

## Usage

All the user must do is start the program by entering "node employeeTrackerData" into the command line followed with selecting and answering prompts. A link to a video demonstration can be found [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b2OjnpvRS1FHFLUudqe5MJOZghO1nR8A/view?usp=sharing)
